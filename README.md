# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

A series of Python Classes with methods designed to extract data, clean data, and initialise a database.

## Description

The aim of this project was to build Python classes to extract and clean data, and to upload that data to a database.

While the methods can be adapted for use on other sources of data, they were designed for a set of data from specific sources, for uploading to pgadmin.

## Installation instructions

The python (.py) files each contain a Class. To use them, copy/paste the code into your own Python code, or simply download file.

## Usage instructions

The classes are not currently functional, but the methods can be extracted as functions and adapted for use.

Copy and paste the method, fix indentation, and remove 'self' from the list of parameters.
